LightIndex is my potential future mod project for Minecraft in which the user can control parameters regarding hostile/neutral mob spawns in varying degrees of light. This mod aims to customize Minecraft's rules determining mob/NPC spawning relative to their lightmap scale (runs from 0-14 in-game) to create a more user-oriented experience.

Another ambitious idea that I have is to include a feature for LightIndex to introduce additional customizable parameters for the sun's heat level. This would affect various aspects of the gameplay loop, including farming and crop growth, likelihood of random fires (in all biomes, also potential support for Biomes O' Plenty), and the regulation of the user's own health and hunger levels.

If anyone who happens to stumble upon this repository/README has any suggestions, improvements, additional features, elaboration, or questions, feel free to send me a message on GitHub or on my other socials at @thebigvice (@thebigviceLIVE on Twitter/X)!

Note: I'm hopeful that I'll be revisiting this project in the future as my coding skills and abilities improve with time. As for now, my levels of involvement and development are going to stay quite low, since potential ideas for the LightIndex project are still being worked out. (1/24/25)
