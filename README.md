# lightindex
LightIndex is a potential future mod project for Minecraft in which the user can control parameters regarding hostile/neutral mob spawns in varying degrees of light. This mod would aim to customize Minecraft's rules determining mob/NPC spawning relative to their lightmap scale (runs from 0-14 in-game) to create a more customizable experience.
